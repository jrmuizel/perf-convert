This uses hacked up version of stackcollapse-perf.pl to parse the output of perf script
It would be better if we just had a parser for the perf script output in js

To convert:
$ perf script | stackcollapse-perf.pl | node convert.js

A cool features of this is:
$ perf script | stackcollapse-perf.pl --inline | node convert.js

which will give full stacks (maybe broken) for inlined functions using addr2line
